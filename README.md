### Productive X 
This is an app that allows you to personalize and make a list of your To Do's! This is the perfect app to keep you productive!

### Planning
I wanted to make an app that me and my sister could use to help plan our day and be productive throughout the day without having to contact the person. I knew that I needed user authentication so I could allow each User to have there unique To Do's. I also knew I needed to make a drop down box for when showing all to do's in list format.

### User Stories
* As an user, I want to create my own account.
* As a user, I want to add a new To Do.
* As a user, I want to update a To Do.


### Technologies used:
* HTML
* CSS 
* JavaScript
* JQuery

### Problems
When showing all To do's everytime you click View All it duplicates the todo. 

### Future
I would like to make it where you can use checkboxes to select when done with a To Do for workflow
